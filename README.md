# pokedex-nuxt

> Pokedex built with Vue Nuxt
> This project started as a mirror of the Pokedex-vue version [project](https://github.com/littlemousey/pokedex-vue) but built with Nuxt with universal (server side rendering) mode.

The app is hosted on heroku. You can view the [demo here](https://pokedex-nuxt.herokuapp.com/)
